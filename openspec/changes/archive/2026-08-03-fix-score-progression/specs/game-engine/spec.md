## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Generate Response Stream
The game engine SHALL stream narration chunks from the LLM, format input actions, invoke deterministic pre-action inventory and barter validation, parse status lines to update location, score, and moves, and append narration back to history.

Status parsing SHALL use the single shared `parseStatusLine` function exported by `engine/llm.js` (line-scanning, case-insensitive on `Status`, optional `Moves` field), which is also the parser used by the MCP server. The engine SHALL NOT maintain a second, end-anchored status regex that diverges from it.

The narration text committed to history, the save file, and the extraction queue SHALL be sanitized: echoed `[CURRENT STATUS]` / `[CURRENT INVENTORY]` blocks and the raw status line SHALL be stripped before commit. The raw assistant text MAY be retained for debugging but SHALL NOT be replayed as context.

The game engine SHALL advance `score` deterministically as the adventure progresses, independent of whether the narrator happens to emit a new Score value on the status line. Score SHALL be computed by an engine-side rule (over extracted milestone events) and committed through the same shared status-line path used for location and moves, so a missed status line cannot silently freeze score.

#### Scenario: Processing player action
- **WHEN** user sends an action of type 'do', 'say', or 'story' with text
- **THEN** the action is formatted and validated against the synchronous inventory and barter engines, a stream of response chunks is retrieved from the LLM provider, status updates are parsed from the last status line anywhere in the response (Location, Score, Moves), and final narration is appended to history

#### Scenario: Pre-action barter intent detection
- **WHEN** user sends an action of type 'do' containing barter verbs (`trade`, `barter`, `exchange`)
- **THEN** the engine extracts the item name, validates ownership via SQLite `hasItem()`, and rejects locally with a user message if the item is not held

#### Scenario: Pre-action multi-match ambiguity
- **WHEN** user sends an action with a barter verb and an ambiguous item name matching multiple held items
- **THEN** the engine rejects locally with a disambiguation prompt listing the matching items, without invoking the LLM

#### Scenario: Status line with trailing content is still parsed
- **WHEN** the narrator appends content after the status line (e.g., an echoed `[CURRENT INVENTORY]` block or additional prose) so the status line is not the last line
- **THEN** the last status line in the response is located and parsed, location/score/moves are committed, and the status line is not persisted as narration

#### Scenario: Echoed context blocks are stripped from history
- **WHEN** the assistant response echoes the injected `[CURRENT STATUS]` or `[CURRENT INVENTORY]` blocks verbatim
- **THEN** the blocks are removed from the narration before it is committed to history, and the history entry contains only the sanitized narration

#### Scenario: Score advances on a quest milestone
- **WHEN** a playtest session completes a quest objective (e.g., delivering a quest datachip, purging a criminal record)
- **THEN** the engine's score increases deterministically and `dungeon_inspect_state` reflects the new score, independent of the narrator's status-line wording

#### Scenario: Score does not stay frozen across a full arc
- **WHEN** a multi-act adventure runs to completion
- **THEN** `score` reflects accumulated milestones (non-zero), rather than remaining at the initial value for the entire session

### Requirement: Game State Persistence
The game engine SHALL support saving the current state (including location, score, moves, system prompt, lore cards, history, and summary) to a JSON file, and loading a previously saved state using its adventure ID.

Score SHALL be persisted and restored exactly (round-trip), so a scored progression survives save/load.

#### Scenario: Saving active game state
- **WHEN** the engine save function is called
- **THEN** the active engine properties are serialized and written to a JSON file in the designated save directory, including the current `score`

#### Scenario: Loading game state
- **WHEN** the engine load function is called with a valid adventure ID
- **THEN** the state is read from the JSON file and all engine properties are updated to match the saved values, including the saved `score`

#### Scenario: Score round-trips through save/load
- **WHEN** a session with a non-zero score is saved and then loaded
- **THEN** the restored `score` equals the saved value
